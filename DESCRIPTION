Description: 
    Umbrella for the alabaster suite, providing a single-line import for all alabaster.* packages.
    Installing this package ensures that all known alabaster.* packages are also installed,
    avoiding problems with missing packages when a staging method or loading function is dynamically requested.
    Obviously, this comes at the cost of needing to install more packages,
    so advanced users and application developers may prefer to install the required alabaster.* packages individually.
